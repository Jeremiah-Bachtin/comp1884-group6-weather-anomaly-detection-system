# CONTRIBUTING

## 🤝 How to Collaborate on This Project

### 📁 1. Work in Your Notebook First
Each teammate has a notebook under `/notebooks/`. Start coding there.

- Jeremy → `notebook_jeremy_ETL_and_ML.ipynb`
- Marie → `notebook_marie_xai.ipynb`
- Nad → `notebook_nad_dashboard.ipynb`
- Dipo → `notebook_dipo_community.ipynb`

### 🧪 2. Experiment and Test
- Use print statements or plots to verify your logic
- Do **not** modify `.py` scripts until you're confident your code works

### 📦 3. Production-Ready Code
Once your code works, tell Jeremy or copy the clean version into:
- `scripts/xai/` (Marie)
- `scripts/dashboard/` (Nad)
- `scripts/community/` (Dipo)

Jeremy will review any major changes to the modelling or ETL code.

### 🧼 4. Commit to GitHub
Use VS Code or GitHub Desktop to stage, commit, and push changes.
Avoid committing:
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`
- `.venv/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `.idea/`

This project is collaborative but production-minded!
